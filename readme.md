# Skyscanner challenge
## Group flying app

## URL
http://legitflight.sakalauskas.co.uk/ or http://legitflight.com/ 

## Motivation

We as a group made a decision to create collaborative tool for people to discuss and select
best options for deciding where to travel. We incorporated Skyscanner API to achieve this.

## How it works

Its very simple - you just need to select the city you want to fly from and press a button.
You will be redirected to personalized web page, which you can share with your friends and together
find the best option.
